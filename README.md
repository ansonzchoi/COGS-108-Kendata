Project Overview
This project examines the demographic factors influencing the likelihood of individuals participating in Kendo, a traditional Japanese martial art, in U.S. colleges. By analyzing data on race, gender, age, major, and occupation, we aim to identify trends and provide recommendations for increasing diversity and accessibility within the Kendo community.

Methodology
Data Collection
We surveyed Kendo practitioners from 11 universities and dojos, focusing on their race, gender, college year, major, and occupation. We compared this data with national enrollment and career data to understand how demographic factors relate to Kendo participation.

Key Findings
Race: East Asian/Pacific Islander participants are overrepresented, reflecting the cultural ties to Kendo.
Gender: Most participants identify as male, contrasting with the general college student population, aligning with Kendo's history as a male-dominated sport.
Year Started: The majority began in their first year, with many starting in their third year, possibly due to transfer students seeking new activities.
Major and Occupation: STEM majors and careers in engineering and business were most common, suggesting that financial stability enables participation in this expensive sport.
Recommendations
Outreach: Create targeted workshops and events for underrepresented groups, including women and non-STEM majors.
Accessibility: Offer financial aid or equipment grants to reduce barriers.
Community Engagement: Host inclusive events that showcase Kendoâ€™s cultural aspects.
Further Research: Explore additional factors like social media impact and family influence.

Conclusion
Our findings reveal demographic trends in Kendo participation and highlight the need for greater inclusivity and support to make the sport accessible to diverse groups.
