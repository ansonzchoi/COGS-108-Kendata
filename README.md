# README: Analysis of Demographic Variables and Kendo Participation

## Project Overview

This project analyzes demographic variables that influence the likelihood of individuals choosing to participate in Kendo, a traditional Japanese martial art. The goal of our research was to understand key factors such as race, gender identity, age, major, and occupation and how they impact Kendo participation among college students in the United States. By leveraging this analysis, we aim to provide insights that can help promote diversity and inclusivity within the Kendo community.

## Project Objectives

1. **Identify demographic trends**: Analyze the correlation between race, gender, year started in college, major, and occupation with Kendo participation.
2. **Compare findings to national data**: Use datasets such as the Race and Ethnicity Status of Undergraduate Enrollments and Projected Degrees Granted from 2010-2031 to contextualize our findings.
3. **Promote inclusivity**: Provide actionable recommendations to Kendo clubs and dojos on how to attract a more diverse participant base.
4. **Address accessibility barriers**: Highlight economic and social challenges that may deter individuals from exploring Kendo and suggest solutions.

## Methodology

### Data Collection
Our team collected raw data through surveys distributed to Kendo practitioners from 11 universities and their affiliated dojos. The survey included questions about the respondents' race, gender identity, age, college year started, major, and current occupation.

### Comparative Analysis
We compared our data with national data sources to observe trends and disparities. This included the Race and Ethnicity Status of Undergraduate Enrollments and Projected Degrees Granted from 2010-2031 to benchmark the demographic distribution of Kendo participants against broader student populations and career pathways.

### Key Variables Analyzed
1. **Race and Ethnicity**
2. **Gender Identity**
3. **Year Started in College**
4. **Major**
5. **Occupation**

## Key Findings

### 1. Race and Ethnicity
- **Observation**: East Asian/Pacific Islander individuals are significantly overrepresented in the Kendo community compared to the general U.S. population.
- **Insight**: The deep cultural ties between East Asian communities and Kendo likely contribute to this demographic trend.

### 2. Gender Identity
- **Observation**: The majority of Kendo participants identified as male, contrary to the broader trend in higher education where more college students identify as female.
- **Insight**: This aligns with Kendo's history as a male-dominated sport, but the recent increase in female participation suggests an evolving landscape.

### 3. Year Started in College
- **Observation**: Most participants started practicing Kendo in their first year of college, with a significant number starting in their third year.
- **Insight**: The finding suggests that transitioning into college, especially for transfer students, is a time when individuals are more likely to explore new extracurriculars.

### 4. Major and Occupation
- **Observation**: Kendo participants were more likely to be enrolled in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) majors, with business economics being an exception. Careers in engineering and business were also the most common among participants.
- **Insight**: The higher earning potential in STEM fields and business may enable students to better afford the costs associated with Kendo equipment and training.

## Recommendations

### 1. **Targeted Outreach**
- Develop marketing strategies and introductory workshops to reach underrepresented groups, including women, non-East Asian communities, and students in non-STEM fields.

### 2. **Accessibility Initiatives**
- Offer scholarships or financial assistance to help offset the costs of Kendo equipment and training. This could make the sport more accessible to students from various socioeconomic backgrounds.

### 3. **Community Engagement**
- Organize events that celebrate the cultural aspects of Kendo while fostering an inclusive environment. Engage with local communities to raise awareness and attract more participants.

### 4. **Further Research**
- Conduct additional studies to explore other potential influences on Kendo participation, such as social media impact, familial influence, and age demographics.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into the demographic factors that influence Kendo participation. By sharing these findings, we hope to empower Kendo clubs and dojos to implement strategies that attract a broader range of participants and address barriers related to race, gender, and economic constraints. With a focus on inclusivity and accessibility, the Kendo community can grow to reflect the diverse backgrounds and experiences of its members.
